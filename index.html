	<h1 id="top-left">Unparalleled Performance</h1>
	<p id="paragraph2" align="left">Learn Adobe has been built from the ground up to support lightning fast, unparalleled performance. Using a variety of techniques, such as pre-caching, accessing already downloaded files and script hosting through Google<br><br>
	Learn Adobe stores crucial files in your computer so when you re-access the website, those files can be utilised as quickly as your hard drive can run. Learn Adobe also uses cloud hosting of scripts through Google. Instead of having to re-download a script to your computer and store it in a seperate location for this website only, the website takes the script that you have already downloaded and utilises that one instead. <br><br>
	The website is also hosted through Github, ensuring that the website is kept consistently online for years to come, with minimal to no downtime. Other techniques such as downloading all background images before running the website keeps the website consistently smooth throughout use after first load.
